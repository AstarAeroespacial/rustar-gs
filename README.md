# RUSTAR - Ground Station Software

**RUSTAR** (Rust Satellite Ground Station Software) is a project developed as part of a final professional thesis at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Buenos Aires, in the context of Astar Aerospacial program.

This software aims to serve as the TT&C system for a **ground station** that communicates with satellites. It is being developed in **Rust**, a systems programming language known for its performance and reliability.

## üì° Project Description

**RUSTAR** is a modular software platform and its architecture is composed of the following key components:

- Orbital Tracking Module
- *SDR* Module
- Telemetry and Command Module
- Database
- Graphical User Interface

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Rust** ‚Äî Core language for implementation.
- **GNU Radio** ‚Äî Signal processing toolkit used to interface with *SDR* hardware.
- **Markdown and LaTeX** ‚Äî Used for project documentation and report generation.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `report/` ‚Äî Contains the LaTeX source files for the technical report.
- `src/` (to be added) ‚Äî Will include the Rust source code for the software.
- `README.md` ‚Äî Project overview and information.
