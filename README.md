# RUSTAR - Ground Station Software

**RUSTAR** (Rust Satellite Ground Station Software) is a project developed as part of a final professional thesis at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Buenos Aires, in the context of Astar Aerospacial program.

This software aims to serve as the control system for a **ground station** that communicates with satellites. It is being developed in **Rust**, a systems programming language known for its performance and reliability.

## 📡 Project Description

**RUSTAR** is designed to:

- Establish and manage communications between a terrestrial station and satellites.
- Interface with *bladeRF* SDR.
- Support automation and telemetry data handling.
- Provide an extendable and robust platform for future satellite missions.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Rust** — Core language for implementation.
- **LaTeX** — Used for project documentation and report generation.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `report/` — Contains the LaTeX source files for the technical report.
- `src/` (to be added) — Will include the Rust source code for the software.
- `README.md` — Project overview and information.

## 👥 Team

- Alen Davies  
- Luca Lazcano  
- Juan Ignacio Medone Sabatini
- Rubén Bohórquez  

## 📄 License

This project is currently for academic purposes. Licensing information will be added as development progresses.
